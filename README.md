# 🌱 Plant Health Monitoring System 🌿
An innovative embedded solution designed to track vital environmental factors influencing plant growth while automating irrigation when necessary. This system utilizes soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors to gather real-time data and activates a motor pump via a relay module when soil moisture falls below a set threshold. An LCD display with an I2C module ensures effortless data visualization.

## Key Features:
✅ Real-time Monitoring – Continuously measures soil moisture, temperature, and humidity

✅ Automated Irrigation – Activates a motor pump via a relay module

✅ LCD Display with I2C – Provides clear real-time sensor readings

✅ Standalone Operation – Powered by a 5V lithium-ion battery for portability

✅ Energy Efficient – Designed for low power consumption


## Hardware Components:
🔹 Arduino – Manages data processing and system operations

🔹 Soil Moisture Sensor – Detects water levels and triggers irrigation

🔹 DHT11 Digital Sensor – Monitors temperature and humidity

🔹 Lithium-ion Battery (5V) – Ensures a portable and reliable power source

🔹 Relay Module (5V) – Controls motor pump activation based on moisture readings

🔹 Motor Pump – Automatically irrigates when soil moisture is low

🔹 16x2 LCD Display with I2C Module – Displays real-time environmental data
